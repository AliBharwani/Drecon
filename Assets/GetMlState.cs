     At each control step the policy is provided with a state s in R^110
    The state contains:
    Center of Mass velocity in R^3 for kinematic and simulated character

    The desired horizontal CM velocity from user-input is also considered v(des) - R^2

    The diff between current simulated character horizontal
    CM velocity and v(des) = v(diff) R^2


    For a subset of bodies:
    Left Toe, RightToe, Spine, Head, LeftForeArm, RightForeArm
    We compute positions and velocities then concatenate these giving s(sim)
    and s(kin) in R^36

    The smootehd actions produced in the previous step of the policy are collected
    in y(t-1) in R^25

    Animated character body positions, velocities, CM velocity, and
    desired CM velocity are resolved in reference frame F(kin), which
    is formed from the horizontal heading of the kinematic character,
    the gravity direction, and positioned at the character CM
        -> Means multiply those by inverse of kin root bone rotation

    The exact same procedure is used for the simulated character positions and
    velocities, except with a frame F(sim), which is identical to F(kin) in
    orientation but positioned at the simulated characterâ€™s CM position.
        -> Means multiply by inverse of kin root bone rotation but keep sim position
